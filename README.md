Summary:
In the first iteration, we used YouTrack to create and manage tasks for the Trivia Maze project. We estimated task durations and tracked progress across the development week.

Highlights:

- Completed setup tasks like GitHub repo creation, database integration, and some UI elements.
- Tracked time for each member, averaging over 10 hours of effort per person.

Issues Faced:
